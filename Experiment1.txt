Experiment 1:

Questions:
A. For each of the Write RPC sets above, count the number of RPCs that were successful and the number that were unsuccessful.

Successful RPCs: 5 ( 5 Write with 1.5s timeout succeeded)
Unsuccessful RPCs: 5 ( 5 Write with 0.5s timeout failed)

B. If the numbers are different for the 2 scenarios, can you explain why? If the numbers are the same for the 2 scenarios, can you explain why?

The number of successful RPCs is different in both the cases because the server write_delay of 1 sec was greater than the 0.5s timeout provided to the write RPC call in Experiment 1 A and smaller than the 1.5sec timeout provided in the experiment 1 B. 
The timeout allowed the RPC call to succeed in one case and tieout exception in the other.

C. What did List return in both cases? Why?

The List opration in the both the cases resulted in the same out of the dictionary containing all the 5 keys becuase even though the 
RPC call reponse back to the client failed due to timeout, the request was still completed on server. The Timeout of 5 sec in the 
A part also helped in the completion of all Write request before List was called and 1.5 sec timeout in part B allowed all Write requests
to complete before List being called.
